The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields 
such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.
Example

month = 8 day = 14 year = 2017

The method should return MONDAY as the day on that date.
